At it's core, Spring is a container (often referred to as the Spring Application Context). This container holds all of an applications components (Services, Repositories, etc). These components are wired together inside the Spring Application Context to create a complete Application.

The act of wiring beans together is based on a pattern called [Dependency Injection]({{< relref "20210118114746-dependency_injection" >}}). The Spring Application Context creates and maintains all the components and injects them where they're needed.
